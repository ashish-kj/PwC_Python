# PwC_Python
To run the code we need to run the PwC.py. Then we need to open the address provided by the server i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8050/.
Then we need to click anywhere on the screen(outside the map region) for the code to start working. We can alter any of the checkpoints and the corresponding graph will be displayed soon after the page is updated. Clicking on any of the icons will provide its description at the bootom of the page on the desription box.
